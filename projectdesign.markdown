__Ideas:__
:dancer:

1. THE TABS
    * Twitterish style (recent one float, more important ones float) of requests 
    * Submit Requests
    * Food calendar
    * Donation Requests
2. DATABASE
    * Logins
    * Current and history of requests

:moneybag: __Design Criteria:__ :moneybag:

1. DONATIONS (paypal? Google wallet)
    * Probably working with google wallet
    * javascript  
2. SUBMIT Requests
3. PUSH email notifications of accepted requests for admins (as they happen or in a weekly statement)
4. PC-FOCUSED app design

:floppy_disk: __Backlog:__ :floppy_disk:

1. TIMELINE of uploaded requests and announcements (news feed)
    * Notifications (emailing admin?)
2. CALENDAR of events with free food
    * Crowd Sourced
    * Embeded google calendar
    * Limit access to approved students
3. INCENTIVIZE the donations
```
Method for how we construct the entire app, by priority:
    - Create skeletons for each priority in order 
    - Put “muscle” on each priority in order
    - Put skin on each priority in order
So we are all organized! And if we run out of time, first (and second?) priority will at least be finished.
```
:clipboard: __Priorities:__ :clipboard:

1. DONATIONS
    * Meet with actual people (low ses)
    * Figure out paypal api 
        i. Figure out specific donations vs general donations vs monthly 
        ii. Figure out how to make anonymous 
2. SUBMIT requests/logins
    * A lot of database stuff
    * Figuring out simple input/output stuff
    * Sign-up structure
        i. Do we make one big account or several accounts (for low-SES members
        ii. Everyone has account for requests 
        iii. Input box? 
        iv. Invite to login?
        v. gmail/facebook login? 
3. CALENDAR
    * Like ScrApp?
        i. See ScrApp doc
    * Connect through google api
        i. Groups with remaining food/events with a lot of food or extra funding can add to calendar 
        ii. Random people can add events they see 
        iii. Hopefully can add to calendar without SEEING calendar. ONLY low SES can see calendar, so as not to ruin it for them 
4. GUI and fun shit! 

:speech_balloon: __Communication:__ :speech_balloon:

* Possibilities for Low-SES to decide:
    1. WHO is admin? 
    2. DO we want accounts for everyone?
    3. CAN only one person have control?
    4. OR is “admin” more of a representation of the group as a whole
        i. So like one admin login but only discussed during meetings
    5. HOW can we make your job easier
    6. WHAT do _you_ want? 
* Questions for Reed®:
    1. IS this all cool with you?
    2. CAN we make admin a job?
        * FWS?? 
* Meeting with LSES:
    1. GIVE them our “pitch” 
        * Make a pitch
        * draw/photoshop a mark up of what the GUI could look like
    2. ASK our questions 
    3. GIVE them the floor
    4. PLAN consistent meetings so they are a part of the process the whole time
        * If they want to 
    5. CREATE a joint google drive thingish for conversations throughout the process
